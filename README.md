# GDP-per-capita-analysis
This analysis uses two datasets (world population and world GDP) accessed from the World Bank. I used the GeoPandas visualisation tool to plot a set of choropleth maps representing the world GDP per capita for the years 1995, 2005, and 2015 respectively. This uses both the datasets simultaneously for calculating the GDP per capita.
